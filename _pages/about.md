Hello! I am a PhD student, part of the `MLIA` team of the [ISIR](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/) laboratory of Sorbonne University.

As of now, I'm deeply engaged in exploring the practical applications of graph neural networks (GNNs) for effectively modeling temporal graphs.

You can contact me at effrosyni.papanastasiou @ etu.sorbonne-universite.fr .
