Hello! I am a PhD student, part of the `MLIA` team of the [ISIR](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/) laboratory of Sorbonne University.

I am currently interested in understanding better how online social networks work using the latest optimization techniques.

Feel free to contact me at effrosyni.papanastasiou @ etu.sorbonne-universite.fr .
