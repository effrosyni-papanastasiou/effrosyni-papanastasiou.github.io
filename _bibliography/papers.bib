  title={Constrained Expectation-Maximisation for inference of social graphs explaining online user-user interactions},
  author={Effrosyni Papanastasiou and Anastasios Giovanidis},
  abstract = {Current network inference algorithms fail to generate graphs with edges that can explain whole sequences of node interactions in a given dataset or trace. To quantify how well an inferred graph can explain a trace, we introduce feasibility, a novel quality criterion, and suggest that it is linked to the result's accuracy. In addition, we propose CEM-*, a network inference method that guarantees 100\% feasibility given online social media traces, which is a non-trivial extension of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm developed by Newman (2018). We propose a set of linear optimization updates that incorporate a set of auxiliary variables and a set of feasibility constraints; the latter takes into consideration all the hidden paths that are possible between users based on their timestamps of interaction and guide the inference toward feasibility. We provide two CEM-* variations, that assume either an Erdos Renyi (ER) or a Stochastic Block Model (SBM) prior for the underlying graph's unknown distribution. Extensive experiments on one synthetic and one real-world Twitter dataset show that for both priors CEM-* can generate a posterior distribution of graphs that explains the whole trace while being closer to the ground truth. As an additional benefit, the use of the SBM prior infers and clusters users simultaneously during optimization. CEM-* outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods in terms of feasibility, run-time, and precision of the inferred graph and communities. Finally, we propose a heuristic to adapt the inference to lower feasibility requirements and show how it can affect the precision of the result.},

  title = {Opening up echo chambers via optimal content recommendation},
  author = {Antoine Vendeville and Anastasios Giovanidis and Effrosyni Papanastasiou and Benjamin Guedj},
  abstract= {Online social platforms have become central in the political debate. In this context, the existence of echo chambers is a prob- lem of primary relevance. These clusters of like-minded individuals tend to reinforce prior beliefs, elicit animosity towards others and aggravate the spread of misinformation. We study this phenomenon on a Twitter dataset related to the 2017 French presidential elections and propose a method to tackle it with content recommendations. We use a quadratic program to find optimal recommendations that maximise the diversity of content users are exposed to, while still accounting for their preferences. Our method relies on a theoretical model that can sufficiently describe how content flows through the platform. We show that the model pro- vides good approximations of empirical measures and demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimisation algorithm at mitigating the echo cham- ber effect on this dataset, even with limited budget for recommendations.},

  title={Bayesian Inference of a Social Graph with Trace Feasibility Guarantees},
  author={Effrosyni Papanastasiou and Anastasios Giovanidis},
  abstract={Network inference is the process of deciding what is the true unknown graph underlying a set of interactions between nodes. There is a vast literature on the subject, but most known methods have an important drawback: the inferred graph is not guaranteed to explain every interaction from the input trace. We consider this an important issue since such inferred graph cannot be used as input for applications that require a reliable estimate of the true graph. On the other hand, a graph having trace feasibility guarantees can help us better understand the true (hidden) interactions that may have taken place between nodes of interest. The inference of such graph is the goal of this paper. Firstly, given an activity log from a social network, we introduce a set of constraints that take into consideration all the hidden paths that are possible between the nodes of the trace, given their timestamps of interaction. Then, we develop a nontrivial modification of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm by Newman [1], that we call Constrained-EM, which incorporates the constraints and a set of auxiliary variables into the inference process to guide it towards the feasibility of the trace. Experimental results on real-world data from Twitter confirm that Constrained-EM generates a posterior distribution of graphs that explains all the events observed in the trace while presenting the desired properties of a scale-free, small-world graph. Our method also outperforms established methods in terms of feasibility and quality of the inferred graph.},
